# Base images for Docker that are always up to date

**NOTE:** This is still a work in progress.

These images are automatically built, tested and pushed on a daily basis, so they're always up to date.

---

## Development

Build the images (**WARNING:**: Currently removes _all_ leftover containers once done):
```sh
./docker-make.sh --no-push
```
